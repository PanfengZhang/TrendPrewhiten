# TrendPrewhiten
# Prewhitening to eliminate the influence of serial correlation on the Sen's slope trend estimator and Mann-Kendall test.
# The result of the Mann-Kendall test depends strongly on the autocorrelation. If there is a positive autocorrelation in 
# the time series, the test rejects the null hypthesis H0 more often than specified by the significance level.
